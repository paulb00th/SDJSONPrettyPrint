SDJSONPrettyPrint - The Slow JSON Serializer
============================================

SDJSONPrettyPrint transforms a compatible Foundation-based object tree into
a JSON string.  It is not designed to be a fast, production-ready JSON
serializer, for that you probably want [JSONKit](https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit).
SDJSONPrettyPrint focuses on producing the most human-friendly JSON possible, 
which you can use for logging or debugging purposes.
